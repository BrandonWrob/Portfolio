## ChronoCTI: Mining Knowledge Graph of Temporal Relations Among Cyberattack Actions published

URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884120

Publisher: Published in the Annual International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) by IEEE.

Publication Date: 9/12/2024

Description: Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattacks describe the sequence of actions of attackers in terms of time. The sequence contains temporal relations among attack actions, such as a malware is first downloaded and then executed. Information related to temporal relations enables cybersecurity practitioners to investigate past cyberattack incidents and analyze attackers' behavior. However, cybersecurity practitioners must extract such information automatically, in a structured manner, through a common vocabulary to reduce human effort and enable sharing, and collaboration. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in proactive defense against attacks by automatic information extraction of temporal relations among attack actions from cyberthreat intelligence reports. We propose ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for extracting temporal relations among attack actions from CTI reports. The attack actions are represented as MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and the relations are represented as a knowledge graph. To construct ChronoCTI, we build a ground truth dataset of temporal relations and apply large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. ChronoCTI demonstrates higher precision but lower recall performance on a real-world dataset of 94 CTI reports. ChronoCTI achieves macro precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.75, 0.46, and 0.54, respectively. ChronoCTI aids practitioners in analyzing large volumes of CTI reports, thinking like attackers, and knowing what attack actions are likely to happen next, which enables the practitioners to assess imminent threats and strengthen their cybersecurity readiness.

## Towards a Taxonomy of Challenges in Security Control Implementation

URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10917356

Publisher: Published in the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) by IEEE.

Publication Date: 9/13/2024

Description: Cybersecurity researchers and practitioners identify and design security controls (e.g., the use of strong passwords), which refer to the countermeasures and safeguards to protect information systems‚Äô confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The effectiveness of controls depends on their implementation. However, controls may have technical and operational issues that challenge effective implementation. Systematizing such challenges would benefit practitioners in enhancing their defense. The goal of this study is to aid security practitioners in defending against cyberattacks by constructing a taxonomy of challenges in security control implementation. We first obtain information regarding the challenges of implementing security control, cataloged in MITRE ATT&CK, using three Large Language Models: ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot. Then, using inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we construct a taxonomy comprising 73 challenges across 8 high-level categories and map the taxonomy with the security controls. We perform a case study on attack techniques in MITRE ATT&CK to identify the challenges associated with security controls for mitigating prevalent attack techniques. We identify that 9 out of 24 prevalent attack techniques do not have any security controls. The rest of the prevalent techniques can be defended. However, the effectiveness of the controls associated with the rest of the prevalent techniques can be limited due to the following: human resources requirements, false positive issues, static detection rules, disruption, and user inconvenience. Our work highlights that security control implementation is subjective, where a diverse set of organizational, technical, human, and external factors can impact its implementation. We recommend organizations not treating security controls as a ticking-off checklist, rather resolve the impeding issues in their implementation.

## Mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports

Publisher: Published in Knowledge and Information Systems by Springer Nature

Publication Date: 5/13/2025

Description: ChronoCTI is an automated system that extracts temporal relations among cyberattack actions from cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports. By mapping actions to MITRE ATT&CK techniques and structuring them as a knowledge graph, ChronoCTI helps security practitioners understand attacker behavior and support proactive defense. Built using large language models, NLP, and machine learning, ChronoCTI achieves high precision on real-world CTI data. Analysis of 713 reports revealed 124 recurring attack patterns across 9 categories, with the most common involving user deception and malware evasion. The findings support using ChronoCTI for designing defenses such as user training, system hardening, and automated detection of recurring threats.
 
## Build It Clean: Large-Scale Detection of Code Smells in Build Scripts

URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17948

Publisher: Published in the 2025 Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) by IEEE.

Publication Date: 8/17/2025

Description: "Build It Clean: Large-Scale Detection of Code Smells in Build Scripts", which has been accepted for IEEE ASE-2025 and will be presented in November 2025! The attached article is the rough draft of the paper, the official paper will be published in IEEE mid-October 2025. This study investigates code smells in build scripts, which automate software compilation, dependency management, testing, and packaging. Through qualitative analysis of 2,000 GitHub issues and static analysis of 5,882 build scripts from 4,877 repositories, we identified 13 categories of code smells, totaling 10,895 occurrences. Insecure URLs were most common in Maven, Hardcoded Paths/URLs in Gradle and CMake, and Wildcard Usage in Makefiles. Co-occurrence patterns revealed structural issues, such as links between hardcoded paths and duplicates. We propose mitigation strategies to enhance build script reliability, efficiency, and maintainability.
