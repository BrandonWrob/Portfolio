### Overview

A full-stack store management application with database management, automated testing, role-based features, built-in security, and a user friendly interface. I originally developed this project as part of a small team using Agile-Scrum methodologies, including sprint planning, biweekly stand-ups, and detailed documentation (Javadocs, UML diagrams, and system tests). I’m now continuing to expand the project alongside other peers who are using it as a foundation to explore new frameworks, add functionality, and enhance the system’s overall capabilities.
